## Repository layout

- `product/` is the canonical documentation + integration content.
- Root-level build/release scripts (`*.bat`, `*.spec`, `VERSION.txt`) are packaging utilities.
- `release/` and `release_assets/` hold generated/customer-facing distribution assets.

## Testing release policy

- Do not resend a new tester app for GitHub sync-only or documentation-only updates.
- Resend the Operator Package only when candidate runtime behavior changes.
- Keep one published test baseline until a new candidate is intentionally announced.
