# DiveNET: Sealink-OEM - Basic Ranging Guide (UART)

This guide explains how to perform basic range (distance) measurements using the Sealink-OEM acoustic modem over a serial (UART) interface. The system uses two-way travel time (propagation time) to calculate distance between two units.

## Key principle

The Sealink-OEM measures the acoustic propagation time from a ping request to the response.  
The reported `propTime` is the **one-way** propagation time in seconds (from initiator to responder).

Distance is calculated as:

`range (m) = propTime (seconds) × sound_speed (m/s)`

- No further division is needed — the modem already computes the one-way time internally.
- Default sound speed used in examples: 1500 m/s (typical for seawater at ~20°C, moderate salinity).
- Real-world accuracy is typically ±0.15–0.5 m depending on sound speed precision and environmental conditions.

## 1. Requirements

### General requirements
- At least two Sealink-OEM units powered and at least one connected via UART (9600 baud, 8N1, 3.3 V logic) for serial communication with a host system.
- Units must be on the same code channel (`txChID` and `rxChID` typically both 0 by default; configurable via protocol commands).
- Python environment with `pyserial` package installed on host machine.
  - **Note on XP5 pin 3 (`SVC/CMD`): This pin functions as a digital strobe output for transmit/receive events. It can be used by external systems for independent ToF timing. It does not improve nominal precision. No user action is required for normal UART protocol operation.**

### Dryland functional testing
- Place transducers within six inches of each other.
- **Note: Dryland operation is not designed to support payload data integrity! It is useful for functional testing only!**

### Water trials
- Devices positioned inside direct line of sight (LoS) and within maximum acoustic range (1 km or 3 km depending on transducer option).
- Supportive testing conditions - preferably open, calm waters, at least 3 m to surface or bottom, and away from any large sound reflective surfaces.

## 2. Manual Ranging (via Serial Terminal)

Use any serial terminal (PuTTY, Tera Term, screen, minicom, etc.) at 9600 8N1.

### Step-by-step example:

**1. Connect to the local (initiator) unit via UART.**


**2. Send a ping request:**

`$PUWV2,0,0,0*2A<CR><LF>`

   - `0` = `txChID` (transmit channel)
   - `0` = `rxChID` (receive channel)
   - `0` = `rcCmdID` (remote command ID: 0 for ping)
   - `*2A` = example checksum (NMEA XOR of bytes between $ and *)

Note: The ping command does not include a target address. Units must be pre-configured with matching channels.


**3. Immediate acknowledgment from local modem (ACK):**

Typical ACK format:
`$PUWV0,cmdID,errCode*checksum<CR><LF>`

Example:
`$PUWV0,2,0*XX<CR><LF>`

   - `cmdID` = `2` (for `$PUWV2`)
   - `errCode` = `0` (no error; see protocol for other codes)

If `errCode` ≠ `0`, look up error code (e.g., invalid syntax, transmitter busy).


**4. Wait for response from the remote unit (automatic reply if in range and listening):**

Typical response format:
`$PUWV3,txChID,rcCmdID,propTime,MSR,value,azimuth*checksum<CR><LF>`

Example:
`$PUWV3,0,0,0.002489,22.75,,*1B<CR><LF>`

   - `propTime` = one-way propagation time in seconds
   - `MSR` = mean main lobe to side-peak ratio in dB (signal quality indicator)


**5. Calculate range:**

`range ≈ 0.002489 × 1500 = 3.7335 m`

## 3. Automated Ranging with Python Script

The repo currently includes a [basic ranging script](resources/uart-getRange.py).

This script:

- Opens a serial port (set correct port name in the code)
- Sends a single ping request using sentence `$PUWV2,0,0,0*2A`
- Waits for and parses a `$PUWV3` sentence response
- Prints the calculated range using a hardcoded sound speed of 1500 m/s

Basic usage:

1. Edit the script to set your COM port (e.g., COM3 on Windows, /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux/Mac).
2. Run: `python uart-getRange.py`
3. Observe the printed range (or error if no response).

Example output (if successful):
`Range: 3733.5 m`

**Note: The test script is designed for basic range testing only. For accurate results, add improved distance formula, set accurate ambient parameters, and multiple result avereging.**

## 4. Sound Speed Compensation Table

Sound speed varies with temperature, salinity, and depth. Use these approximate values or measure on-site.

| Water Type          | Temp (°C) | Salinity (ppt) | Depth (m) | Sound Speed (m/s) |
|---------------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Freshwater          | 20        | 0              | 0         | 1482              |
| Seawater (typical)  | 20        | 35             | 0         | 1522              |
| Seawater            | 10        | 35             | 0         | 1490              |
| Seawater            | 25        | 35             | 0         | 1534              |
| Deep ocean (avg)    | 4         | 35             | 1000+     | 1480–1550         |

## 5. Tips for Reliable Ranging

- Max range — Up to 1,000 m (SW-T100 transducer) / 3000 m (SW-T200/300 transducers) in supportive conditions (clear, calm, open water, low noise).
- Shallow water / multipath — Use averaging (run script multiple times); avoid strong surface/bottom reflections or large reflective surfaces.
- Signal quality (MSR) — Higher dB values indicate cleaner link.
- No response? — Check: matching channels? Powered on? In water? Transducer connected?
- Power saving — Units only transmit during pings; keep Rx duty cycle low.

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- No `$PUWV3` response → May receive `$PUWV4` (timeout); check acoustic path, verify remote listening, confirm channel match.
- Inconsistent ranges → Environmental factors; repeat measurement and average manually.
- Checksum errors → Ensure terminal/script computes NMEA XOR correctly.
- Error in ACK (`$PUWV0`) → Check `errCode` (e.g., 3 = transmitter busy, 4 = out of range); resolve before retrying.
